## Project Workflow
Exceeds Expectations. Wow, great wireframes! You app looks close to if note better than your wireframes. I imagine they helped a lot in your polishing process. Your readme is very detailed and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it!

## Technical Requirements
Exceeds Expectations. Great job. I love the object oriented approach you took toward flashcards. Really helps your code be more modular and maintainable. We can change smaller component parts without worrying too much about breaking the application.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. Great job jen, code is well commented and properly indented. I encourage you to start abstracting functionality into separate files so we can separate our concerns.

## Problem Solving
Exceeds Expectations. I'm glad you decided to utilize constructor functions to implement this solution. Using object oriented design is ideal for this sorty of thing. Each flashcard should be representative of its own properties and attributes. And you can see how easy it would be to add something like category to these flashcards.

## Overall

Really great job Jen! I'm really happy with your project, Let me know if you have any questions/concerns about my feedback.
